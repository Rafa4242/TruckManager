A simple python project, intended for an university activity.

It was developed by three people in the time range of a single week of summed work, and has the features of a truck manager, 
which was the project goal. The grade received for it was 10/10.\
The original project is available with the tag 1.0 in releases.

This is a reworked version made to run in a docker.

The following command builds the image and runs the CLI in an interactive shell within the docker
```bash
chmod +x ./build_docker.sh
sudo ./build_docker.sh
```
